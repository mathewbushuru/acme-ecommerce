          This project aims to create commerce modules and tools to build rich,

        </p>
        <p>
          It contains modularized commerce logic like carts, products,
          authentication, pricing, order management, and tools you can use to
          build powerful ecommerce websites.

          Acme is a fictional corporation from the{" "}
          <span className="italic">Wile E. Coyote</span> animations and is used
          as a generic company name in many cartoons. In the past, it was
          commonly used in the names of real businesses in order to be listed
          towards the beginning of alphabetized telephone directories like the

          company.

        <p>
          I am designing this system to be as fault-tolerant as it could
          possibly be which is going to involve a bit more work since e-commerce
          systems have a decent number of moving parts. The system can be
          divided at a high level into four parts - the client(user), the API,
          the database and payments processor.
        </p>
        <img src="/docs/high-level-overview.jpg" className="mx-auto max-h-40" />

        <p>
          The main approach to achieving fault-tolerancy is by using replicas.
          For example, our MySQL database on AWS has an exact replica as shown
          below.
        </p>
        <img src="/docs/database.jpg" className="mx-auto max-h-40" />

        <p>
          The first single point of failure in the system above is the API. We
          have a single API server in our system, and if it fails, the user is
          completely unable to interact with our system. To solve this, we are
          simply going to duplicate our API server and introduce an API load
          balancer.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/docs/high-level-overview2.jpg"
          className="mx-auto max-h-60"
        />

        <p>
          We have a similar problem with the load balancer, if it fails then our
          whole system is down again. A workaround for this is to have load
          balancers with different IP addresses and configure our DNS to return
          both IP addresses. If we pass in our domain name e.g{" "}
          <span className="font-mono">acme.mathewbushuru.com</span>, the DNS
          server translates that into a set of two IP addresses. When a browser
          receives multiple ip addresses for a domain, it will either use a
          round-robin approach or pick the first one. And if one of them is not
          available, it will try another. Downsides of this approach are: DNS is
          usually cached on the client making it harder to introduce new load
          balancers, and in the event that a load balancer is down, there is
          increased latency to find the working one. But that's better than the
          whole system going down.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/docs/high-level-overview3.jpg"
          className="mx-auto max-h-60"
        />

        <p>
          The other single point of failure is the Payments Processor. This
          becomes easier when using third-party services because these services
          offer Service Level Agreements (SLA) that give us the expected uptime.
          For example, Stripe which is one service I will be integrating has an
          uptime of 99.9999%. We can introduce a standby payment processor but
          this increases complexity since different services have different
          APIs.
